# hangman-python
Hangman game self project

## What
This is the firt solo project of the BeCode's AI bootcamp using Python. We are asked to 
code the <Hangman<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>.

##Why
This project will allow to test our comprehension of the new material we learned during the firs two weeks of the training.

## How
The code should be clean and use the concepts of class, attributes and methods,
 but also typing and regular expression.
I imported the random and re packages.
I created a Hangman class.
Inside the class, I created attributes (the word to discover, the number of tries, the number of lives (remaining),...).
Methods are also created as advised: design the play, start the plays and finish it either a game over or a well played game.
